# Security Management

Ensuring the security of your Debian system is a core task in system administration. This guide covers several key areas to help you harden your system against potential threats.

## üîê User and Access Control

Limiting access to the system is the first line of defense.

### Enforcing a Strong Password Policy

Use the `libpam-pwquality` module to enforce the creation of more secure passwords.

1.  **Install the module**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
    ```

2.  **Configure the policy**:
    Edit the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file to define your password rules.
    ```ini
    # Example configuration:
    minlen = 10                  # Minimum length of 10
    dcredit = -1                 # At least 1 digit
    ucredit = -1                 # At least 1 uppercase letter
    lcredit = -1                 # At least 1 lowercase letter
    ocredit = -1                 # At least 1 special character
    difok = 3                    # At least 3 characters must be different from the old password
    ```

### SSH Security Hardening

SSH is the most common way to access a server remotely. Here are some hardening recommendations:

1.  **Edit the SSH configuration file**:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```

2.  **Recommended settings**:
    - **Disable root login**: `PermitRootLogin no`
    - **Disable password authentication (keys recommended)**: `PasswordAuthentication no`
    - **Enable public key authentication**: `PubkeyAuthentication yes`
    - **Change the default port (optional)**: `Port 2222`

3.  **Restart the SSH service**:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart sshd
    ```

## üî• Firewall Configuration (UFW)

Debian does not enable a firewall by default. `UFW` (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a user-friendly frontend for managing `iptables`.

1.  **Install UFW**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ufw
    ```

2.  **Configure basic rules**:
    ```bash
    sudo ufw default deny incoming   # Deny all incoming connections
    sudo ufw default allow outgoing  # Allow all outgoing connections
    sudo ufw allow ssh               # Allow SSH connections (or your custom port)
    sudo ufw allow http              # If it's a web server, allow HTTP
    sudo ufw allow https             # Allow HTTPS
    ```

3.  **Enable UFW**:
    ```bash
    sudo ufw enable
    ```
    The system will warn that this may disrupt existing SSH connections; confirm to proceed.

4.  **Check the status**:
    ```bash
    sudo ufw status verbose
    ```

## üîÑ Automatic Security Updates

Applying security patches promptly is crucial. `unattended-upgrades` can install security updates automatically.

1.  **Install it**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
    ```

2.  **Enable it**:
    Run the configuration wizard, which will create a basic configuration file.
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades
    ```
    Select "Yes" in the dialog that appears.

3.  **Fine-tune the configuration (optional)**:
    You can edit `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` to customize its behavior, such as enabling automatic reboots.

## üõ°Ô∏è Intrusion Prevention (Fail2Ban)

`Fail2Ban` monitors log files and automatically updates firewall rules to ban IP addresses based on suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts.

1.  **Install Fail2Ban**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install fail2ban
    ```

2.  **Create a local configuration file**:
    Do not edit the `.conf` files directly. Instead, create a `.local` file to override them.
    ```bash
    sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    ```

3.  **Configure SSH protection**:
    In `jail.local`, find the `[sshd]` section and ensure `enabled = true`. You can adjust `maxretry` and `bantime`.
    ```ini
    [sshd]
    enabled = true
    port    = ssh
    maxretry = 3
    bantime = 3600  # Ban for 1 hour
    ```

4.  **Restart the service**:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
    ```

## üìù Log Management and Auditing

Regularly checking system logs is key to identifying unusual activity.

- **Using `journalctl` to view logs**:
  ```bash
  # View all logs (oldest to newest)
  journalctl

  # Follow logs in real-time
  journalctl -f

  # View logs for a specific service, e.g., sshd
  journalctl -u sshd.service

  # View kernel logs
  journalctl -k
  ```
