# Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to the most common Debian 13 questions.

## üöÄ Installation Questions

### Q: Which Debian 13 image should I download?

**A:** For most users, the **DVD-1** image is recommended as it contains a complete desktop environment and can install offline. If you have fast internet, the **netinst** image is smaller and downloads the latest packages during installation.

### Q: Can I install Debian alongside Windows?

**A:** Yes! Debian supports dual-boot installations. The installer can automatically resize Windows partitions to make space for Debian, or you can manually partition your drive.

### Q: My WiFi doesn't work during installation. What should I do?

**A:** Download the **firmware** version of Debian 13 which includes non-free drivers, or use an ethernet connection during installation and install WiFi drivers afterward.

### Q: How much disk space do I need?

**A:** Minimum 10GB, but 20GB+ is recommended for a comfortable desktop installation with room for your files and applications.

## üñ•Ô∏è Hardware Compatibility

### Q: Will Debian work on my old computer?

**A:** Debian supports a wide range of hardware. For computers older than 10 years, consider using the **i386** (32-bit) version or a lightweight desktop environment like **Xfce** or **LXDE**.

### Q: My graphics card isn't working properly. Help!

**A:** For NVIDIA cards, install the `nvidia-driver` package. For AMD cards, the open-source drivers work well out of the box. You can also try booting with `nomodeset` parameter for troubleshooting.

### Q: Can I run Debian on Apple Silicon Macs?

**A:** Debian has experimental support for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macs through the **arm64** architecture, but compatibility is limited. Consider using virtualization software for better compatibility.

## üì¶ Software and Packages

### Q: How do I install software in Debian?

**A:** Use the `apt` package manager:
```bash
sudo apt update                    # Update package list
sudo apt install package-name     # Install software
sudo apt search keyword           # Search for software
```

### Q: Can I install .deb files from other distributions?

**A:** Generally not recommended. Debian packages are specifically built for Debian. Installing packages from Ubuntu or other distributions may cause conflicts.

### Q: How do I enable non-free software?

**A:** Edit `/etc/apt/sources.list` and add `contrib non-free non-free-firmware` to your repository lines, then run `sudo apt update`.

### Q: What's the difference between Stable, Testing, and Unstable?

**A:** 
- **Stable**: Rock-solid, older packages, perfect for servers
- **Testing**: Newer packages, good balance of stability and features
- **Unstable**: Latest packages, may have bugs, for experienced users

## üîß System Configuration

### Q: How do I change my desktop environment?

**A:** Install a new desktop environment (e.g., `sudo apt install kde-desktop`) and select it at the login screen, or use `sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm3` to change the default.

### Q: My system is slow. How can I improve performance?

**A:** 
- Disable unnecessary startup services
- Use a lighter desktop environment (Xfce, LXDE)
- Add more RAM if possible
- Use an SSD for storage
- Disable visual effects

### Q: How do I set up printing?

**A:** Install CUPS: `sudo apt install cups printer-driver-all`. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:631` to configure printers.

## üåê Network and Internet

### Q: How do I connect to WiFi from the command line?

**A:** Use NetworkManager:
```bash
nmcli dev wifi list              # List networks
nmcli dev wifi connect "SSID" password "password"
```

### Q: My internet is slow in Debian. Why?

**A:** 
- Check if you're using the correct WiFi drivers
- Try different DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
- Disable IPv6 if causing issues
- Check network adapter power management settings

### Q: How do I configure a static IP address?

**A:** Edit `/etc/network/interfaces` or use NetworkManager's GUI. For modern systems, use `nmcli` or the network settings in your desktop environment.

## üîê Security and Updates

### Q: How do I keep my system updated?

**A:** Run these commands regularly:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade    # Update all packages
sudo apt full-upgrade                  # Major upgrades
sudo apt autoremove                    # Remove unneeded packages
```

### Q: Do I need antivirus software?

**A:** Linux is naturally more secure, but you can install `clamav` if desired. Good security practices (regular updates, careful with downloads) are more important.

### Q: How do I configure the firewall?

**A:** Debian uses UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):
```bash
sudo ufw enable                    # Enable firewall
sudo ufw allow ssh                 # Allow SSH
sudo ufw status                    # Check status

### Q: Can I run Windows programs on Debian?

**A:** Use **Wine** to run many Windows applications, or consider virtualization software like **VirtualBox** for running Windows in a virtual machine.

### Q: How do I play multimedia files?

**A:** Install multimedia codecs:
```bash
sudo apt install vlc
sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras  # Or debian-multimedia packages
