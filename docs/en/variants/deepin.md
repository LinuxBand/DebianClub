# Deepin

Deepin is a Linux distribution developed and maintained by Wuhan Deepin Technology Co., Ltd. in China. Based on Debian stable, it is best known for its self-developed DDE (Deepin Desktop Environment), which is widely regarded as one of the most visually polished and refined desktop environments available on any operating system. The current major release series is deepin 23.

## Key Features

- **Stunning DDE desktop**: Smooth animations, a cohesive visual language, a macOS-inspired Dock, and a unified Control Center make DDE one of the most aesthetically pleasing desktop environments on any platform.
- **Chinese application ecosystem**: The Deepin App Store includes native Linux versions of WeChat, WPS Office, NetEase Cloud Music, Baidu Netdisk, and other applications commonly used in China — ready to use after installation.
- **DDE is available on other distros**: DDE has been ported to Arch Linux, Fedora, NixOS, and others, so you can experience the Deepin desktop without switching to the full Deepin distribution.
- **deepin 23 architecture improvements**: Based on Debian 12 Bookworm, deepin 23 introduces the Linglong application format for improved sandboxing and cross-distro app compatibility.
- **Active open-source community**: DDE and most core Deepin applications are open source, hosted on GitHub, with an active international contributor base.

## Relationship to Debian

Deepin is based directly on Debian stable, drawing packages from official Debian repositories plus Deepin's own proprietary and community repositories. The DDE desktop environment, Deepin File Manager, Deepin Terminal, Deepin Screenshot, and other bundled applications are entirely self-developed and not sourced from Debian. deepin 23 aligns with Debian 12 Bookworm and follows Debian's security update track.
